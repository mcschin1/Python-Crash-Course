    "### Install\n",
    "\n",
    "Python runs on windows, linux, mac and other environments. There are many python distributions available. However the recommended way to install python under Microsoft Windows or Linux is to use the Anaconda distribution available at [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows]. If you are installing python from elsewhwer, make sure you get at least Python *3.8* version, not 2.7. The Anaconda distribution comes with the **[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)** collection of scientific python tools as well as the iron python notebook. For developing python code without notebooks consider using **[spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder)** (also included with Anaconda) or your favourite IDE under windows, mac etc (e.g. **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)** which handles both plain python programs and notebooks) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the “Anaconda” **[installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the “Windows” option just above the downloads.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Double click and Run the Anaconda installer\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Click Next.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Read the licensing terms and click “I Agree”.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Select an install for “Just Me” unless you’re installing for all users (which requires Windows Administrator privileges) and click Next.\n",
